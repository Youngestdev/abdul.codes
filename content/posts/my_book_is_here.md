In August 2021, I wrote on my blog that [I was writing a book](https://www.blog.youngest.dev/read/i-m-writing-a-book) on building web APIs with FastAPI. I have written this follow-up blog post informing you that I have completed my debut book.

## O porrr, my author

Pls, I saw **shege** while writing this book. I've been writing technical articles and documentation for four years, and I kid you not, writing a book isn't as straightforward as a technical article.

## Shege?

I'm a skilled technical writer, and I wrote most of my published articles you see on the internet in half an hour to an hour. Indeed, I thought it'd be the same for the book, but I was wrong. I spent days writing a paragraph - ridiculous.

The timeline for this book was five months from September, but I wrote the last draft on the ninth month from the initial draft submission date.

It's a wonderful process.

The editorial team is the best I've worked with in an extended period ( the best remains Matt from LogRocker ). Mostly, the editor's feedback is just style fixes, suggestions and minor details, and for a first-time author, it's an exciting feat for me.

Alhamdulillah.

## What the book covers

In bullet points, this is what the book covers:

- Set up a FastAPI application that is fully functional and secure
- Understand how to handle errors from requests and send proper responses in FastAPI
- Integrate and connect your application to a SQL and NoSQL (MongoDB) database
- Perform CRUD operations using SQL and FastAPI
- Manage concurrency in FastAPI applications

How about you find out in-depth what the book covers by getting the book?

## Getting the book

After all my wahala and sleepless nights, I think it's just proper that you get the book and read it. _Sapa ti hook mi atm so I mean, mo le lo some money_.

> Translation: I'm currently being held hostage by the lack of money. Some money won't be wrong.

The book becomes available to the public from the **29th of July** and can be purchased as either an eBook or paperback on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1801076634).

I'm happy to sign your paperback copies if you get them :D.
