After an amazing one year working with Okteto, I am back in the job market looking for another place to contribute my excellent skills to.

---

At Okteto, I was responsible for handling community affairs as well as create technical and later on marketing content for the audience - users, customers, etc.

Professionally, I have 4+ years worth of experience writing technical articles for various blogs ( listed at the end of this blog post ), as well as a documentation for a joint [crypto library](https://github.com/youngestdev/buycoins-python). I have also recorded a numbers of videos on Youtube for Okteto as well.

Safe to say that I am skilled at what I do - Technical writing.

## Is writing all you do?

No. I happen to be a skilled Python programmer primarily focused on building [quick toolings](https://github.com/Youngestdev/treasure-hunter) and building web APIs with FastAPI:
- [FastAPI + Mongo Boilerplate](https://github.com/Youngestdev/fastapi-mongo)
- [iVote API - WIP](https://ivote.youngestdev.co)
- [GetBoarded - WIP](https://getboarded.co/).


## Works.
### Books.

Still WIP: Building Web APIs with Python and FastAPI
