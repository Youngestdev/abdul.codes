The docs are very nice too.</p>\n<p>That marks the end of the Amazon part, I will be moving on to learning from a book called \"DevOps Bootcamp\" alongside numerous contents on the web ranging from videos to articles.</p>\n<p>The DevOps bootcamp book's content looks very well arranged, and I believe that it should be a good start for me. I also would be learning advanced bash scripting since I have very basic knowledge of <strong>bash</strong>, I'll also be studying more internal linux thingy ( OS in general ) - IO, Memory Management, etc.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Truth be told, there's so much to learn, and I'm excited. I'm trying to be confident in myself because doubting will only make me lag and not progress. I have downloaded a couple of books on DevOps which I'll spend more time on and write what I learn from them on this my little blog.</p>\n<p>I downloaded books on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Infrastructure as Code</li>\n<li>Designing Distributed Systems</li>\n<li>Implementing DevOps on AWS</li>\n<li>Learning DevOps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stay tuned, I'll try to write on this blog daily :) </p>\n","date":"28 May 2020","timeToRead":1,"image":null}},"context":{}}
