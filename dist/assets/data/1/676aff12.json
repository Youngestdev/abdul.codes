I really want to venture into DevOps full time and probably decline offers ( except a few from people I hold in high regards).</p>\n<p>I mean, I have an interview with Google next year, I could study hard to ace it but I want to focus more on DevOps - Cloud engineering. I'm confused, I can do both, I'll do both.</p>\n<h2 id=\"do-both-\"><a href=\"#do-both-\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Do both ?</h2>\n<p>Uhm. The Google interview requires me to study hard and solve data structures and algorithmic questions. On the other hand, my heart is at DevOps..</p>\n<p>What do I do? Idk. I'll just try to balance my activities, and study for both accurately. I mean, if I focus more on the algorithms and data structure, and leave what my heart truly want, I'll never be contented, fulfilled and satisfied.</p>\n<p>I have a habit of making sure I do things I love, irrespective of how hard it might be. Although a tech expert &#x26; a personal mentor, Edem, helped clarify basically that every aspect of tech has its uses and that's actually true. It is ideal to have both knowledge, how do I manage the mental stress &#x26; burden doing both brings? How am I sure I'm not being partial to any of the study?</p>\n<p>It's not like I'm very good at data structures and algorithms per se, truth be told, I'm really not good at many things. I'm just a smart ass that's able to manipulate things to get what he wants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-why-not-use-your-smartness-\"><a href=\"#so-why-not-use-your-smartness-\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>So why not use your \"smartness\" ?</h2>\n<p>Idk. I'm confused lol. I think what I lack is confidence, and the subsequent fear of \"what if I don't do well ?\".. I know it's normal to have these fears but, omo, I can't manage all these emotions in my small brain. Welp.</p>\n<p>I can only just build my confidence over time and my skills. Interview is temporary, the skill is permanent.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Idk, I'm just here writing things as they flow from my head. It might not make much sense but I hope to come back to this post and laugh at my old personality that lacked confidence.</p>\n<p>Teinz. </p>\n","date":"2 June 2020","timeToRead":2,"image":null}},"context":{}}
