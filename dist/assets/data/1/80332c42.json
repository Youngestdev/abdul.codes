I mean HOW DID I SPEND SO MANY HOURS CONFIGURING BUILDS AND ONE DIDN'T EVEN WORK ?</p>\n<p>Yeah, I know I'm just starting out but omo, no be here. I'll go and learn how to work with Travis CI, GitHub actions, Azure DevOps and Gitlab CI etc.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So basically, today was about learning what Continuous Integration is all about. CI has to do with engaging a particular build of an app or software in series of tests, builds itself, compilations and static code analysis. </p>\n<p>The book I'm currently reading focused on Jenkins. It is a CI tool, I installed it and created a new job that passed a build. Jenkis also allows the integration of plugins to test code quality and statically carry out code analysis ( SonarQube).</p>\n<p>I was unable to integrate the static code analysis plugin to work well in Jenkins, I've left it alone. Maybe some other time in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"challenges\"><a href=\"#challenges\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Challenges</h2>\n<p>The book I was reading wasn't detailed enough for a beginner, however, as a result, I was able to learn more by googling. I had many issues fixing the build, but it was fun all through.</p>\n<p>I also had issues installing SonarQube ( and Postgres majorly ) but <a href=\"https://techexpert.tips/sonarqube/sonarqube-installation-ubuntu-linux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this article</a> was very helpful. Upon all my wahala, it didn't work for the build, but WE MOVE!.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tomorrow\"><a href=\"#tomorrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Tomorrow,</h2>\n<p>I'll be looking into the container section of the book where I'll be introduced to Docker and maybe other ones. I'll also try to study on other CI tools, I have tried Travis before, so I believe the others should be easier than Jenkins.</p>\n<p>Until then, if you were here, drop a comment.</p>\n","date":"29 May 2020","timeToRead":1,"image":null}},"context":{}}
